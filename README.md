# Community Type Travel Platform - Tripssoda

## Introduce
When planning a trip, it is not easy to match the schedule even with best friends.<br>
“Tripssoda” is a community-type travel platform designed to solve this problem.<br> 
You can easily find companions by sharing travel locations and schedules.<br> 
And it is designed to sell travel products through cooperation with partner travel agencies.<br>
